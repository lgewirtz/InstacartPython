# Instacart Sale Patterns

Using Python and Excel, this project explores and analyzes sales, product and customer Instacart data. It then recommends a new advertising strategy.

Specifically, Instacart wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Their stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their datbase along with their purchaing behaviors.  They would like to target different groups of customers at the times of the day and times of the week they would find most useful.
